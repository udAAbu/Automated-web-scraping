# Automated-Web-Scraping
Learn to scrap timely updated data from Reddit using rvest package

Instead of scrapping from web manually every time, this project aims to automatically scrap timely changing political news and their related comments from Reddit every hour, and does some naive sentiment analysis on these comments to learn about how people's attitude changes during such unsettled time in US. This automated process can also send hourly email to us to show people's overall sentiment score during every hour.
